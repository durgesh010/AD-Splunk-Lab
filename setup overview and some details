# VMware Pro Lab Setup for Security Testing

This document outlines the steps to configure a secure virtual lab environment using VMware Workstation Pro for security testing purposes.

## Network Details

* Network Type: NAT (Network Address Translation)
* Subnet: 192.168.21.0/24
* DHCP: Enabled (Automatic IP assignment)

## Virtual Machines

### 1. Windows 10 Client

**Local User Details:**

* Username: target
* Password: Password1234@ (**Note:** This is a placeholder for a strong password)

**Static IP Configuration:**

* IPv4 Address: 192.168.21.10
* Gateway: 192.168.21.2

**Log Generation and Sharing:**

* Install the following tools in endpoints/windows hosts:
    * Universal Splunk Forwarder
    * Sysmon (download from https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon)
    * Sysmon Olaf Config (download from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/olafhartong/sysmon-modular/refs/heads/master/sysmonconfig.xml)
* **Sysmon Setup Commands:**
    ```powershell
    cd C:\Users\target\Downloads\Sysmon
    .\Sysmon64.exe -i ..\sysmonconfig.xml
    ```
* **Splunk Forwarder Configuration:**
    * Modify the `inputs.conf` file located in `C:\Program Files\SplunkUniversalForwarder\etc\system\local` according to Splunk documentation.
    * Restart the Splunk Forwarder service after making changes.

### 2. Windows Server 2025

**Static IP Configuration:**

* IPv4 Address: 192.168.21.20
* Gateway: 192.168.21.2

### 3. Kali Linux for Attacking

**Tools and Scripts:**

* Install security testing tools such as Hydra, Nmap, Metasploit Framework, John the Ripper, and custom scripts for simulating attack vectors.

### 4. Splunk Server (Main System)

**Splunk User Details:**

* Username: Durgesh
* Password: *********** 

**Settings:**

* Open the Splunk web portal and navigate to:
    * Settings -> Forwarding and Receiving -> Receiving Configuration
    * Add port 9997 to receive logs from endpoints.
* Create a new index named "endpoint" in Splunk for storing logs.

## Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) Setup (Optional)

**Admin Details:**

* Username: Administrator
* Password: Password1234@ 

**Domain Details:**
* Domain Name: dev010.local

**Organizational Units (OUs):**

* Create OUs named "IT" and "HR" to manage user accounts and group policies.

**Users:**

* **IT OU:**
    * John Snow (jsnow) - Password: Password1234 (**Note:** This is a placeholder for a strong password)
* **HR OU:**
    * Akash Kumar (akash-k) - Password: Password1234@ (**Note:** This is a placeholder for a strong password)

## Objectives

1. Set up Kali Linux and security testing tools.
2. Perform a brute-force attack with Hydra (**Note:** This should be done in a controlled environment with proper authorization).
3. View logs and telemetry data in Splunk for security analysis.
4. Install and configure Atomic Red Team for simulating real-world attack techniques.
5. Run Atomic Red Team tests to evaluate the lab environment's security posture.

## Steps

1. **Enable RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) on Windows Server or Windows 10** for remote access during testing (System Settings -> Advanced System Settings -> Enable Remote Connections for users).
2. **Create a Password Wordlist** for brute-force attacks using appropriate tools (**Note:** Use strong passwords in production environments).
3. **Log Analysis/Monitoring with Splunk:**
    * Use search queries like `index="endpoint" akash-k` to analyze user activity logs in Splunk.
    * Look for event codes indicating failed login attempts in the "Fields" section.

4. **Install Atomic Red Team and Emulate Threats:**
    * Install Atomic Red Team using the following PowerShell
