Atomic Red Team Tests

Test 1: T1136.001 - Create Account

Objective: Simulate the creation of a new user account in the target system to mimic an attacker's persistence method or privilege escalation technique.
Tool Used: Atomic Red Team (ART)

Steps Performed:
Executed Atomic Red Team's predefined test for creating a user account using the command Invoke-AtomicTests T1136.001.

powershell Command:
Invoke-AtomicTests T1136.001

Log Analysis:
Monitored logs in Splunk for EventCode 4720 (Account Created).
However, the log observed was EventCode 4726 (Account Deleted), which indicates that the account was deleted after creation.
Outcome: The test created a new account and then deleted it, as indicated by EventCode 4726. This demonstrates the detection of both account creation and deletion in Splunk.
